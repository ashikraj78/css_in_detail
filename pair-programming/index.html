					<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
					<p>Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.</p> <br>

					<h2>Why do we use it ?</h2>
					<p>In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a filler text commonly used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content that could be distracting with placeholder text may allow viewers to focus on graphic aspects such as font, typography, and page layout.
					You might wonder why a designer would choose to use lorem ipsum text instead of a few paragraphs in English or their native language. Why not just copy and paste a page from an old book or something?The main reason for this is to keep people from focusing on the actual text. When someone creates a template (or uses a free template website) and wants to get feedback on it, they don’t want the people reviewing it to get distracted by what the text says.Additionally, lorem ipsum closely resembles actual text. Copying and pasting the same few words would result in an uneven distribution of letters. With lorem ipsum text, you can focus on how the font and page layout looks with almost-real copy.In that way, it’s a bit like the sentence “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. Windows uses this when previewing fonts, as it uses all the letters of the alphabet.</p>

					<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
					<p>While lorem ipsum text looks like gibberish, it’s actually rooted in a real Latin work. It comes from Cicero’s 45 BC work “De finibus bonorum et malorum” (On the ends of good and evil), which is a look at ethics. The lorem ipsum text comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33.However, the common lorem ipsum text we use today is not proper Latin. Compared to Cicero’s work, our lorem ipsum text is complete gibberish. It’s had words added, removed, and changed that make it far from its initial form.Dr. Richard McClintock discovered the source of the text when searching for the rare Latin word “consectetur” in classical literature. His search turned up Cicero’s work.It’s unknown who made these modifications to the text, or exactly when, to make it the mess of words we know today. Sometime in the 1500s, an unknown printer scrambled words that have survived into the digital age.</p>

					<h2>Column Four</h2>
					<p>The story of Lorem Ipsum is a fascinating one—if you’re into that kind of thing—but its longevity raises a further question: should we still be using it at all, this mangling of a dead language, in a medium as vital and dynamic as web publishing, where “content” refers to hundreds of design elements besides font. Is Lorem Ipsum a quaint piece of nostalgia that’s outlived its usefulness? In answer, you may wish to read Karen McGrane’s spirited defense of the practice. Or, if you feel it’s time to let the garbled Latin go the way of manual typesetting machines, consider perhaps as an alternative “Nietzsche Ipsum,” which generates random paragraphs of mostly verb-less, incoherent Nietzsche-like text, in English. Hey, at least it looks like a real language.</p>
