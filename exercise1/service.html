				<p>
					Hospital has massive 7.5 acre campus provides 600+ beds and houses facilities for over 8+ super-specialties, all under one roof. Each floor is dedicated to a specialisation to ensure that they function as independent hospitals within a hospital and yet have the comfort of collaborating on complex cases. Patients are provided with multiple options for treatment, the most suitable of which are arrived at through a cross-function, cross-specialisation committee such as Tumor board that decides the best course of action

				<p>It was critical to give patients a sense of physical orientation within the building and visual connection with the outside environment.

				<h3>Healing the spirit and soul</h3>
				<p>The founders were very clear that we were to invent a new language for hospital rooms and not mimic a hotel or domestic room. This new language was to embrace spirit of India and combine it with the frontiers of the latest global technology.
